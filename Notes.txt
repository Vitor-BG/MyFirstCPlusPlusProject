For every standard function of c++ you'll need to add a std:: before it to properly use it.
Examples:
std::cout -> Printing values
std::cin -> Receiving values
std::string -> Use Strings
std::endl -> Breaking Lines

When OutPuting data you'll need to use << and when Inputing you'll need to use >>
Examples:
std::cout << "String" << Integer
std::cin >>  Double

For using these types of functions correctly you also need to include some of the C++ libraries.
#include <LIBRARY>

#include<iostrem> (Input, Output, Stream of data)
